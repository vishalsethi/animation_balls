===============

A basic game for 2 players

Aim of the game- to click the button as soon as the 2 balls collide behind the visual obstruction. First player to click the button after collision wins. Clicking before collision means losing the game.

Possible additions - 
1. Scoring System
2. Programatically changing velocity and shape of balls at runtime.
3. Pausing the animation at button click.
